# prework-study-guide

## Description
Coding has intrigued me for years as a "magic" that happens in everyday activities from sending email or reading the news,  to ordering groceries from HEB Curbside. I enrolled in a coding bootcamp to learn the inner workings of some of this "magic" and use the skills in a new career.  I built this project webpage as a central location for notes on topics learned during bootcamp prework. This solves the issue of struggling to read my handwriting and losing paper notes, as this page is displayed in easy-to-read font and accessible from the web.
