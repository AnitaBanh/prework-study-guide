# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
Coding has intrigued me for years as a "magic" that happens in everyday activities from sending email or reading the news,  to ordering groceries from HEB Curbside. I enrolled in a coding bootcamp to learn the inner workings of some of this "magic" and use the skills in a new career.  I built this project webpage as a central location for notes on topics learned during bootcamp prework. This solves the issue of struggling to read my handwriting and losing paper notes, as this page is displayed in easy-to-read font and accessible from the web. 

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?


If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
